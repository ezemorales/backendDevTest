# Getting Started

### About project
* [Backend dev technical test](https://github.com/dalogax/backendDevTest#readme)

### Evaluation
I applied timeouts for external request and handle of errors if not responding. This improves the performance of the app.
I didn´t use memory cache for similar request because i don´t know business logic about that, if always are the same similar ids, also in case of product detail, because it has an important field like availability.   

### Swagger

* [Swagger documentation](http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/index.html)
